Pre-requisites:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the necessary dependencies, including torch, torchvision, matplotlib, and gradio. You can install them using pip:
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib gradio
Run the Visualization Script:

Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) like VSCode or PyCharm.
Copy the entire code provided into a new Python script file, such as visualization.py.
Save the file in a directory of your choice.
Execute the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the visualization.py script.
Run the script by executing the following command:
Copy code
python visualization.py
Interact with the Visualizations:

After running the script, two visualization windows should appear.
The first window displays the weights of the first layer of the neural network model. This visualization helps you understand how the model learns features from input images.
The second window displays the decision boundary for each logic gate (AND, OR, XOR). This visualization shows the model's predictions based on the input data points and the learned decision boundary.
Close the Visualizations:

Once you've finished viewing the visualizations, you can close the visualization windows by clicking the close button (usually an 'X' button) on each window.
